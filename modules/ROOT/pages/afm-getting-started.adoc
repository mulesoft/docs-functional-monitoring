== Monitor Your APIs

Monitor your APIs using the following steps:

. If you want to monitor APIs in Anypoint VPCs or private spaces, xref:afm-create-private-location.adoc[create a private location].

. If you are xref:afm-in-anypoint-platform.adoc[using Functional Monitoring in the Anypoint Monitoring UI]:

.. xref:afm-create-monitor.adoc[Create monitors] for the APIs that you want to test.

.. xref:afm-add-schedules.adoc[Add schedules] for the monitors.

.. If you want to run tests outside of the automatic testing schedule, you can xref:afm-run-test-now.adoc[run a test immediately].

.. xref:afm-view-test-history.adoc[View monitor history] in the Functional Monitoring page to view a list of recent test runs.

. If you are xref:bat-top.adoc[using BAT CLI to run tests using the command line]:

.. xref:afm-install-task.adoc[Install BAT CLI]. 

.. Create a test suite xref:bat-example-test-suite.adoc[from an example] or by xref:bat-start-new-project.adoc[populating the lines yourself].

.. xref:bat-write-tests-task[Write tests] using BDD test-writing syntax.

.. xref:bat-execute-task.adoc[Run a test suite].

.. xref:bat-schedule-test-task.adoc[Schedule testing and monitoring].

.. xref:bat-schedule-for-particular-location.adoc[Create monitors that use a particular location].

. Additionally, you can:

.. xref:afm-download-test.adoc[Download monitors] from Functional Monitoring to use with BAT CLI or to modify and create more complex test cases. xref:afm-upload.monitor.adoc[Upload monitors] you have written or modified to use them in Functional Monitoring.

.. If you want to run reports using BAT CLI, xref:bat-reporting-task.adoc[configure BAT to use one of the supported reporting systems].
