= Creating Monitors

You create monitors via the Functional Monitoring UI or by uploading test suites written in BAT, a Behavior Driven Development (BDD) language. Both methods enable you to create tests against one or more endpoints, and to create test schedules that run at specified intervals. 

This procedure describes creating monitors via the Functional Monitoring UI.

== Before You Begin

* Ensure that you have the following permissions set in Access Management:
+
** *Anypoint Monitoring > Viewer* or *Anypoint Monitoring > Administrator* 
+
and
+
** *Exchange > Exchange Administrator* or *Exchange > Exchange Contributor*
+
An Anypoint Platform administrator for your organization grants permission. See xref:access-management::managing-permissions.adoc[Manage Permissions].

* Determine which endpoints to test and by which REST methods to test them.
* Determine the expected return status codes.
* Determine the test interval.
+
The shortest interval is 15 minutes. Monitors can also run hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly. The schedule begins immediately after creating the monitor, and you can modify the schedule after the monitor has been created. For example:

** Set an hourly schedule to start at a certain number of minutes after the hour begins.
** Set a daily, weekly, or monthly schedule to start at a certain time of day.

* Determine the location in which to execute the monitor.

For details, see xref:afm-monitoring-public-apis.adoc[Monitoring the Endpoints of Public APIs] and xref:afm-monitoring-private-apis.adoc[Monitoring the Endpoints of Private APIs].
* Determine if the requests should include additional headers.
* For optional reporting, obtain one of the following pieces of information:

== Create a Monitor

To create a monitor:

. Click *Create Monitor* in the *Functional Monitoring* section of Anypoint Monitoring.
. Under *Step 1 - Setup the monitor*, specify a monitor name. 
. Click the *Step 2 - Select endpoints* tab.
. Populate the fields for each endpoint with the information gathered in <<before-you-begin>>. By default the monitor validates self-signed certifications for each endpoint, so *Validate SSL Certificate* is toggled on. If you want to allow unsafe self-signed certifications for an endpoint, toggle *Validate SSL Certificate* off.
+
You can preview the test by clicking *Run now* under *Preview the result of your monitor*.

. Click the *Step 3 - Set notifications* tab.
. Optionally configure a notification.
. Click *Create Monitor*.

The *Monitor Detail* view appears, and includes the following actions:

* Click *Run* (image:afm-ui-run-button.png[width=1%,height=1%]) to immediately execute a monitor.
* Click *View Monitor History* (image:afm-ui-history-button.png[width=1.3%,height=1.3%]) to view a list of recent monitor runs.
* Click *More* (image:afm-ui-more-button.png[width=0.75%,height=0.75%]) > *Edit Monitor* to modify a monitor.
* Click *More* (image:afm-ui-more-button.png[width=0.75%,height=0.75%]) > *Download Monitor* to download a monitor as BAT source.
* Click *More* (image:afm-ui-more-button.png[width=0.75%,height=0.75%]) > *Delete Monitor* to delete a monitor.

Additional displayed information includes:

* The most recent test duration
* Time elapsed since the monitor started running
* The average response time for each activity (for example, DNS lookup), separated by day
* The previous five test execution results, as indicated by *PASSED* or *FAILED* (depending on if the endpoints returned expected codes)
* A table displaying the current test schedules
* Each endpoint asserted with its HTTP method

Return to the homepage by clicking *Back to Monitors*.

[NOTE]
====
Tests silently fail when run time exceeds 120 seconds. As a workaround, download the monitor and split the tests across multiple monitors via the BAT CLI. Run and time each test to ensure their running times are under 120 seconds; then, upload the monitors.

Alternatively, to run a monitor for more than 120 seconds, download the monitor and run it from the BAT CLI.
