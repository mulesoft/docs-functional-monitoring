= Getting Started Writing Tests
:page-aliases: bat-playground-task.adoc

A test suite is composed of the following elements:

* A directory that contains a main file named `bat.yaml` that describes the structure of your test suite
* A `config` folder that contains files in which you specify variables
* One or more folders in which you write tests

Tests are written in the BDD Test-Writing syntax and use the `.dwl` file extension.

Before you can write and run tests, you must have access to an Anypoint Platform account. 

[[test-examples]]
== Use Examples to Learn the Basics
Learn the basics of writing tests using the provided examples. 

To select examples:

. In the *Create Monitor* page, click *Switch to code editor*. 
. In the selector menu for the code editor, select a test example. Examples include:
+
** Test an expected status code
** Validate multiple assertions
** Set and reuse variables
** Iterate test
** Extract function
** Assert with regex expression
** Repeat N times
+
The code in the code editor automatically changes to show the selected example code.
+
. Modify the example test for your own needs. See xref:bat-bdd-reference.adoc[] to understand the syntax and write your own tests.
+ 
. Validate whether the test works by clicking *Validate Test*.

NOTE: The example menu is available only when creating a monitor.
