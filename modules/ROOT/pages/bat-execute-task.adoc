= Execute BAT Tests
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

In this procedure, you execute the tests you wrote earlier in the workflow. Using the BAT CLI, you can execute one test at a time or all tests listed in the bat.yaml. By default, BAT generates HTML and JSON reports about the test results.

. Run the `bat` command in the directory where bat.yaml is located.

The output shows the results of the test and location of reports. For example:
