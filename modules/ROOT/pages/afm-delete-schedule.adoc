= Deleting Schedules

:imagesdir: ../assets/images

You might want to delete a schedule for any of the following reasons:

* You have finished testing endpoints of a public API and you want to free resources for testing endpoints of a different public API.
* You have finished testing endpoints of a private API.
* You have more than one schedule running the same test and you no longer need one of the schedules.

[NOTE]
====
Be sure that you want to delete the schedule. There is no opportunity to confirm the deletion.

== Before You Begin

* Before you can delete a schedule, you must have the following permission set in Access Management:

** *Exchange > Exchange Administrator*

* Before you can delete a private location, you must have the following permission set in Access Management:

** *Runtime Manager > Delete Applications*

An Anypoint Platform administrator for your organization grants permission. See xref:access-management::managing-permissions.adoc[Manage Permissions].

== Delete a Schedule

Anypoint Functional Monitoring provides two methods for deleting a schedule.

To delete a schedule from the *Schedules* table of a monitor:

. Select the monitor that contains a schedule to delete.
. Locate the schedule in the table and click *More* (image:afm-ui-more-button.png[width=0.75%,height=0.75%]) > *Delete Schedule*.

To delete a schedule from the table of schedules that use a specific location:

. Display the list of locations by opening the *Locations Manager* in the homepage.
. Select the location from which you want to delete a schedule.
. Locate the schedule in the table and click *More* (image:afm-ui-more-button.png[width=0.75%,height=0.75%]) > *Delete Schedule*.

* If the deleted schedule was the only schedule running a specific test, the worker for that test no longer exists.
* If the schedule was the only schedule using a private location, you have the option to delete that private location.
