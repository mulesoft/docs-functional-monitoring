You might want to delete a schedule for any of the following reasons:

* You have finished testing endpoints of a public API and you want to free resources for testing endpoints of a different public API.
* You have finished testing endpoints of a private API.
* You have more than one schedule running the same test and you no longer need one of the schedules.

[NOTE]
====
Be sure that you want to delete the schedule. There is no opportunity to confirm the deletion.

== Procedure

Anypoint Functional Monitoring provides two methods for deleting a schedule.

To delete a schedule from the *Schedules* table of a monitor:

. Select the monitor that contains a schedule to delete.
. Locate the schedule in the table. Tap *More* (image:afm-ui-more-button.png[width=0.75%,height=0.75%]) followed by *Delete Schedule*.

To delete a schedule from the table of schedules that use a particular location:

. Display the list of locations by opening the *Locations Manager* in the homepage.
. Select the location from which you want to delete a schedule.
. Locate the schedule in the table. Tap *More* (image:afm-ui-more-button.png[width=0.75%,height=0.75%]) followed by *Delete Schedule*.

== Result

If the deleted schedule was the only schedule running a particular test, the worker for that test no longer exists.

If the schedule was the only schedule that was using a private location, you can delete that private location.
