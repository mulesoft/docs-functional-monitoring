You can download a monitor and modify it on your computer. Then, you can either run the monitor by using the BAT CLI or upload the monitor into the online interface for API Functional Monitoring.

If you are new to writing monitors manually, you can download monitors, see how they are structured, and view the content of the files. The knowledge you gain can help you write your own monitors.

== Procedure

. Select the monitor to download.
. Click the monitor to enter the monitor detail page.
. Click *More* (image:afm-ui-more-button.png[width=0.75%,height=0.75%]) > *Download Monitor* to download a monitor as BAT source.

* `<your Anypoint Platform group ID>_<the name of the monitor>_<the test version>.zip`
