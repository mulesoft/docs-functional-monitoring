You can download a monitor and modify it on your computer. Then, you can either run the monitor by using the BAT CLI or upload the monitor into the online interface for API Functional Monitoring.

If you are new to writing monitors manually, you can download monitors, see how they are structured, and view the content of the files. The knowledge you gain can help you write your own monitors.
