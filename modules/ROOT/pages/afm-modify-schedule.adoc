= Modifying Schedules

You can modify a schedule to change:

* The location at which the test is run
* The frequency at which to run the test

== Before You Begin

* Before you run a schedule in a public location, ensure that your Anypoint Platform organization has not reached its maximum number of schedules. When you attempt to create a new monitor, a message displays if no public schedules are available.

* Ensure that your user ID has the following permission set in Access Management:

** *Exchange > Exchange Administrator* or *Exchange > Exchange Contributor*

An Anypoint Platform administrator for your organization grants permission. See xref:access-management::managing-permissions.adoc[Manage Permissions].

== Modify a Schedule

Modify a schedule either from the *Schedules* section of a monitor, or from the schedules list.

To modify a schedule from the *Schedules* section of a monitor:

. Select the monitor in which you want to modify a schedule.
. Find the schedule in the list, click *More* (image:afm-ui-more-button.png[width=0.75%,height=0.75%]), and select *Modify Schedule*.
. In the *Modify Schedule* dialog, change one or more of the following:
+
* The location at which to run the test
* The frequency at which to run the test
. Click *Save*.

To modify a schedule from the schedules list:

. Display the list of locations by opening the *Locations manager* dialog in the homepage.
. Select the location in which the schedule is currently running.
. Find the schedule in the list, click *More* (image:afm-ui-more-button.png[width=0.75%,height=0.75%]), and select *Modify Schedule*.
. In the Modify Schedule dialog, change one or more of these items:
+
* The frequency at which to run the test
* The configuration to run the test
. Click *Save*.

== Result

Changes take place after the current interval elapses. For example, if you change the interval of a schedule from every 15 minutes to every hour and the timer on the monitor shows that there are 5 minutes left in the current interval, the new interval goes into effect after the five minutes elapse and the test is run.
