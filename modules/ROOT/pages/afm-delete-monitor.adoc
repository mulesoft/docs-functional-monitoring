Although you can easily delete unnecessary monitors, there is no cost in keeping them.

== Before You Begin

Ensure that your user ID has the following permission set in Access Management:

* *Exchange > Exchange Administrator*

See xref:access-management::managing-permissions.adoc[Manage Permissions].

== Delete a Monitor

Delete a monitor either from the homepage or from its detail page.

To delete a monitor from the homepage:

. Hover over the test to delete. 
. Click *Delete* (image:afm-ui-trash-button.png[width=1.5%,height=1.5%]).
. In the *Delete Monitor* dialog, click *Delete*.

To delete a monitor from its detail page:

. Select the monitor that you want to delete.
. Click the monitor.
. Click *More* (image:afm-ui-more-button.png[width=0.75%,height=0.75%]) > *Delete Monitor*.
. In the *Delete Monitor* dialog, click *Delete*.

== Result

The monitor and its schedules are deleted. The workers provisioned for the schedules are also deleted, and their consumed resources are made available to other workers.
