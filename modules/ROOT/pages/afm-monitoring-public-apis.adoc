= Monitoring the Endpoints of Public APIs

Public APIs are APIs with endpoints that are exposed to the open internet. In API Functional Monitoring (AFM), tests of such endpoints are run by workers that themselves run in public locations or private locations. A _public location_ is a region (which you can think of as a resource pool) that is shared with other MuleSoft customers. Examples of such regions are `us-east-1`, `us-east-2`, and `eu-central-1`. For information about private locations, see xref:afm-monitoring-private-apis.adoc[Monitoring the Endpoints of Private APIs].

The tests in monitors are run on schedules. For a worker to run in a public location according to a schedule, a schedule must be associated with it. A public location can be associated with more than one schedule for more than one monitor.

The following diagram depicts the types of relationship that can exist between monitors, schedules, public locations, APIs, and environments. The different line types depict the different types of relationship.

.The possible relationship types between monitors, schedules, public locations, APIs, and environments

* First relationship type (represented by solid black arrows)
+
Monitor 1 runs on a single schedule. The schedule is associated with Public Location 1. The monitor is written to test one or more endpoints in public API 1 and in public API 2, though it could also test endpoints in more public APIs. The two APIs are in a single environment.

* Second relationship type (represented by dashed green arrows)
+
Monitor 2 runs on two separate schedules, and each is associated with the same public location. Monitor 2 is written to test one or more endpoints in public API 3 and in public API 4, though it could also test endpoints in more public APIs. The two APIs are in a single environment.

* Third relationship type (represented by dashed-and-dotted blue arrows)
+
Monitor 3 runs on two separate schedules, and each is associated with a different public location. Monitor 3 is written to test one or more endpoints in public API 5 and in public API 6, though it could also test endpoints in more public APIs. The two APIs are in a single environment.

* Fourth relationship type (represented by dotted orange arrows)
+
Monitor 4 runs on two separate schedules, and each is associated with the same public location, though each could be associated with a different public location. Each of the two tested public APIs is in a different environment. One environment could be a test environment, and the other environment could be a production environment. Public API 7 and public API 8 are copies of the same API. Monitor 4 is written to test one or more endpoints in public API 7 and the same endpoints in public API 8, though it could also test endpoints in more public APIs.

* Fifth relationship type (represented by dashed, dark blue lines)
+
Monitor 5 runs on a single schedule, though it could run on two. The schedule is associated with Public Location 2. Monitor 5 is written to test one or more endpoints in public API 9 and in public API 10 (though it could also test endpoints in more public APIs), both of which are accessible on the World-Wide Web.

[NOTE]
====
You can also test private APIs from public locations if you allow the IP addresses of those locations. You can test a private API from a public location if you don't want to use vCores for testing private APIs, or if you have no vCores available.

In Runtime Manager, add a new rule to the firewall for Anypoint Virtual Private Cloud (Anypoint VPC). The type must be *https.port*, the source must be *Custom*, and the port range 8081. For the source, use one of the following IP addresses:

[%header,cols=2*]
|===
|Public Location
|IP Address

|us-east-1
|3.82.89.58

|us-east-2
|3.128.151.139

|eu-central-1
|18.156.106.167
|===

For instructions on adding firewall rules, refer to xref:runtime-manager::vpc-firewall-rules-concept.adoc[VPC Firewall Rules]

== Length of Time Before Tests Time Out

To prevent tests run in public locations from consuming too many resources, AFM prevents tests from executing for more than 120 seconds. A test fails if this maximum length of time is reached. You cannot increase this wait time.

== Scheduling Tests

Tests are run at fixed intervals that you define in schedules. Each test is associated with a schedule. When you run tests from public locations, AFM sets limits on the following aspects of scheduling:

* *Number of Schedules*: By default, your organization can run up to five schedules simultaneously for testing from public locations. If you reach the limit of five schedules and want to run more monitors simultaneously, contact your MuleSoft Customer Success Manager about raising your maximum.

* *Duration of Intervals Between Executions of Tests*: You can schedule test intervals using a cron expression. The minimum duration of intervals between tests is set by account type. See xref:bat-schedule-test-task.adoc#scheduling-limits[Limits for Schedule Intervals by Location].

You can also run monitors from private locations if you have access to Anypoint Virtual Private Cloud. There is no limit to the number of schedules that you can create to use private locations. For details, see xref:afm-monitoring-private-apis.adoc[Monitoring the Endpoints of Private APIs].

You can monitor public APIs from private locations, too, not just private APIs.
