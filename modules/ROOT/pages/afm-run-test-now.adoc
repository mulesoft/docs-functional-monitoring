You can manually run tests outside of the automatic testing schedule without affecting it.

== Before You Begin

Because you are running the test outside of a schedule, you must select the location in which you want it to run. If you want to use the same location as used by the schedule, navigate to the monitor detail page and note that location.

== Procedure

Run a test either from the homepage, or from a test's details page.

To run a test from the homepage:

. Hover over the test to run.
. Click *Run* (image:afm-ui-run-button.png[width=1%,height=1%]).
. Select the location and configuration in which to run the test.
. Click *Run now*.

To run a test from its details page:

. Select the monitor that includes the test to run.
. Click the monitor.
. Click *Run* (image:afm-ui-run-button.png[width=1%,height=1%]).
. Select the location and configuration in which to run the test.
. Click *Run now*.

== Result

The test runs immediately and the results are displayed. The current interval in the associated schedule continues to elapse.
