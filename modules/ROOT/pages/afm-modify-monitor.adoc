= Modifying Monitors

You can modify monitors in API Functional Monitoring, which includes the options to edit the monitor as text fields or to edit the monitor as BAT source. Additionally you can download the monitor as BAT source, edit the monitor in your text editor of choice, and then upload the monitor. You can modify a monitor from either the homepage or the monitor's detail page.
